# Maker's Week 7: Weekly challenge
This challenge was the seventh weekly challenge and the second group based project.
We worked in a three to build this project.

The learning objectives for this week were:

* Build a dynamic single page app using only Pure JS
* Request and use data from an external API
* Explain that libraries are code 

Successes
-----

* I managed to (somewhat accidentally) create a functioning test framework during a lunch time while trying to make a matcher, this framework 
    also allowed you to load tests into a TestSuite and run them all when the browser opened
* By doing this the concept of a library completely changed in my mind, and I see that I could (with time) write one myself



To improve
-----
* The note creation was fragmented and should have been enclosed in a separate function, this way they could be created as hidden divs and then revealed later
* Correctly enclosed note creation function would have allowed the same function to be reused but with modifications to have a single note show on click

THE DREAM TEAM CORPORATION'S NOTEAPP <br />
*** Where people start to notice the notes you're notating ***


User story 1: 

```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```
User story 2: 

```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```
User story 3: 

```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```
User story 4: 

```
As a programmer
I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ðŸ”¥
So I can record notes with fun little pictures
```
